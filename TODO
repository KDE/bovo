Things I want before KDE 4 beta 2
=================================
[ ] Board is way to small at first startup.
[ ] There is no indication the game starts in a demo mode
[ ] Game over message is displayed in status bar. Not nice.
[X] Remove all names from source files. For copyright holders, refer to svn
log. We want collective code ownership.
['] Documentation/Handbook.
    ['] Game rules
    ['] Game features / "Help"
    ['] Game strategies
    ['] Game history (Gomoku, Connect5, ...)
    [ ] Theme creation
[ ] Apidox.
    [X] Ai
    [X] Game
    [ ] Gui
    [ ] Mainpage.dox
[X] Fully i18n.
['] Code beautification.
    [X] Ai
    [X] Game
    [ ] Gui
        [ ] Naming conventions
        [X] Indentation
        [X] close namespace with comments
        [X] close #endif with comments
        [ ] sort functions, methods and properties
        [X] name all #ifdefs __CLASNAME_H__
        [ ] /* comment */ all private stuff
[ ] Tooltips.
[X] Theme support.
[ ] Configuration dialogue.
[X] Save AI level and theme from session to session.
[X] Logic cleanups.
    [X] Allways use Player instead of int
    [X] Give the best AI level a different name
[/] Get rid of exceptions, to fit into KDE (AI left)
[ ] Implement draws (yes, it have never ever happened to me in real life, but it
    is not impossible in theory, ...right?)
[ ] "New game" doesn't mean a loss if it's just started.
[ ] Kidnap an artist for some decent artworks

=============================================================================

THEMES (4.0)
============
[ ] scribble (pen on paper) [IMPROVE]
[X] spacy
[X] gomoku
[ ] KDE vs Gnome
[X] high contrast

=============================================================================

FEATURES (4.1)
==============
[ ] Status message and game events printed "onboard"
[ ] configure dialogue
[ ] keyboard navigation ("no mouse" gameplay)
[ ] That nice new AI...
[ ] KNewsStuff2 for themes
[ ] Winning line fades in, move by move
[ ] "Stains" support
    [ ] Rotate Stains by 90, 180 and 270 degrees
[ ] "Stains" extended (paint all buttons, menus etc in pen-on-paper style)
[-] Change replay & demo playback speed
[ ] Change board size
[ ] "Natural paper" whith coffee stains, etc.
[-] Save a replay
[ ] Open a replay
[-] Save an active game and open it again
[X] Start with latest game when opening
[X] Save stats from time to time
[ ] View history in a right or left pane, where previous moves are displayed.
[ ] Enable GGZ gaming (this means create a GGZ game for this as well I guess)
[ ] Enable LAN gaming (broadcast the local domain for other willing to
    participate.)
    Look into kgamelib or what it is called. Create XML-like open protocol for
    Bovo friends, letting Gnomes play with us (is it possible to add a feature
    to the protocol that allways makes them loose? =P )

ADAPTING AI
===========
ADAPTING AI: AI skill starts at Normal, and then it gets reevaluated after
every gameover. The reevaluation takes into account the last 10 games played (if
10 games hasn't been played yet it's a new user and special rules will apply).
However, this 10 latest games is "evaluated" (who won the most, the player or
the AI?). If AI wins more than 4 out of 10 games, lower the difficulty by a few
points on a 100-level scale. If player wins more than half 7 games out of 10
games, make the AI slightly more challenging. This will mean that the player (as
he/she) gets better will start facing more challenging opponents, but still they
won't be disshearteningly hard. The algorithm is meant to mean that a balance
will occure were the player allways faces an opponent he will win ~60% of the
games against, making him feel good about him/herself, lowering his/her blood
pressure and making him/her like this game. :P
[ ] Implement background cogitating in AI (thinking over possible plays in a
    separate thread while player is thinking).
[ ] Implement forsight in AI (AI guesses what moves the player might attempt)
[ ] Implement depth searching in AI (If player plays this, then I could play
    this and the player could do this and I can do this...).
[ ] Implement width searching in AI (AI evaluates many possible moves; multiple
    depths)
[ ] Make sure width+depth searches is reflected in the "root" of the AI, so the
    AI chooses the path that seems like the best one. AI will be able to
    deselect entirely paths it discovers leads to losses or strong
    playerpositions.
[ ] Implement a board vurdering (count offensive and defensive points appart and
    see which points is valued the most, to guess which player is most likely to
    like a given board).
[ ] When a move is made by the player, drop all know redundant paths from the
    strategy and focus on the ones left.
[ ] Make the AI cogitating thread do multi-tasking. That is, all
    depth-width-searches gets added to a wait list, and the AI will in turn
    vurdere them. Removes from this list should be easy as well (certain losses,
    we want to avoid if the player is not of the weaker kind AND when the player
    plays a move, all children to other moves must be removed -- Actually
    it's better if we just clear eveything specified to be not in a certain
    path.)
[ ] Make the aiboard reversable (return a copy and change the playedID) so it is
    easy to alter between player and AI "thinking".
[ ] Make this super-AI adjustable, by making miss-calculations (only in
    AI-thinking -- it has to presume player is allways a mastermidn) and by
    selecting weaker moves (unless they are extremely obvious, like
    four-in-a-row). Also make the AI weaker by limiting how deep and wide it is
    allowed to calculate.
[ ] Make the width of paths adjustable by how likely they are. If there are many
    similarly pointed moves to make, explore them all, but if there is only a
    few great only evaluate those.
[ ] Set max depth and width. The closer to the root, the "wider" path is
    allowed, and the better paths can also be explored wider and deeper.
[ ] Allow the AI a few seconds of cogitating before forcing it to make a move.
[ ] Find a nice balancing algorithm that ensures the player will face
    slightly-easier opponents.
[ ] If 10 games hasn't been played yet, start with a random difficulty. If that
    proves to be to hard, back down by half (and so on) or double the
    difficulty, until the players starts loosing/winning. Then back down
    halfways to the last value and continue to do so whenever the
    winning/loosing situation changes but keep making it harder/easier if the
    situation doesn't change. When 10 games has passed, start playing with
    normal adaption.
[ ] Turn on highscore and connect that between adapted difficulty of AI and time
    of play.
[ ] Turn on global highscore. Send in exceptionally great levels of difficulty a
    player has reached to an Internet server, so a top-100 masterminds of the
    KDE world list is created. :)
[ ] If window gets inactive, pause the AI cogitating thread.
[ ] Refactor out this cooooool adapting AI into a lib, which all KDE Board games
    could use! (GSoC idea?)

BUGS
====
[X] Several marks are lost when winning line is painted in replay mode. Odd..
[ ] This might be buggy, haven't checked: when starting an autosaved game;
continue the computerbegins-playerbegins sequence (who made the first move in
the history?)
[ ] Area outside of scene isn't updated correctly when switching theme.
[X] Wins vs. Losses is not updated on startup, but at first when one both has won 
    and lost.
[X] At startup, playbackSpeed is reset to 2000, due to it beeing to big. Why?????
[X] Undo crashes.

OTHER
=====
[ ] Move this list to a wiki!
[X] Clean up the namespace mess.
[ ] THE SAME THING WE DO EVERY NIGHT, KONQI: TRY TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!
