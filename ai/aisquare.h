 * aisquare is used by the AI to represent a square in a playing board.
 *
 * This class is used internally by the AI to represent a square in a 
 * playing board. It extends the normal @c square class with possibilities
 * to keep a point attached to the square, as well as a bool marker that
 * tells whether this square needs a recalculation of its points.
 *
 * Examples construction: (create a playing board)
 * @code
 * aisquare** board = new aisquare*[width];
 * for (int x = 0; x < width; ++x) {
 *     board[x] = new aisquare[height];
 * }
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Example point use:
 * @code
 * board[x][y].point = point;
 * @endcode
