/**
 * AiSquare is used by the AI to represent a square in a playing board.
 *
 * This class is used internally by the AI to represent a square in a 
 * playing board. It extends the normal @c Square class with possibilities
 * to keep a point attached to the square, as well as a bool marker that
 * tells whether this square needs a recalculation of its points.
 *
 * Examples construction: (create a playing board)
 * @code
 * AiSquare** board = new AiSquare*[width];
 * for (int x = 0; x < width; ++x) {
 *     board[x] = new AiSquare[height];
 * }
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Example status use:
 * @code
 * if (board[x][y].status()) {
 *     unsigned long points = score(board, x, y );
 *     board[x][y].setPoints(points);
 *     board[x][y].setStatus(false);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example mark needs to be repainted:
 * @code
 * // a neighbour of (x, y) has been marked as belonging to a player,
 * // so (x, y) needs to be recalculated.
 * board[x][y].setPoints(0);
 * board[x][y].setStatus(true);
 * @endcode
