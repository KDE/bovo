 * An AI player
 *
 * This class might be somewhat missnamed. It doesn't just keep track of a
 * playing board on the behalf og the AI. It is the entire AI implementation.
 * it implements two algorithms to calculate best moves and it selects which 
 * move to play. It also can tell if a move is a winning move, but it doesn't
 * track a history yet (but maybe it should?).
 *
 * It uses the standard stuff in common.h way to little.
 *
 * It is supposed to be slaughtered and split up in two, easing the
 * implementation of AdaptingAi (the great feature to come! =P )
 *
 * Perhaps we want to use Qt4 rather than STL in most of these cases. When we
 * implement AdaptingAi we have to depend on Qt4 and/or ThreadWeaver anyways.
