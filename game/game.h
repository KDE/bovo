 * The Game engine

 * It keeps track of the playing board, and its playing history.
 * It can walk up or down the playing history (undo).
 * It can call an AI player of its own, to give the active player a hint.
 * It decides if a game has ended (someone has won or it is a draw).
 * It can tell which is the winning line and the winning move.
